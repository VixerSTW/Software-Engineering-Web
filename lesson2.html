            <h2>Lesson 2: What do Software Engineers do?</h2>
            <p>Software Engineers are responsible for building, testing, and maintaining software applications. They work with different technologies to create programs that solve real-world problems.</p>

            <h3>Common Tasks of a Software Engineer:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Writing Code:</strong> Using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java to create applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging and Fixing Errors:</strong> Identifying and resolving issues in the code.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborating with Teams:</strong> Working with designers, product managers, and other developers.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing Software:</strong> Ensuring applications work correctly before they are released.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining and Updating Software:</strong> Improving and fixing software over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Software Engineers work in different fields such as web development, mobile app development, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>

            <p>Next, we'll learn why Software Engineering is an important skill to have!</p>
